Tic Tac Toe Game
Developed an interactive Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enables two players to compete in real-time. The application features:

Dynamic Gameplay: Players can take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, with real-time updates on their current status and turns.
Win and Draw Detection: Implemented logic to check for winning conditions or a draw after each move, providing instant feedback to players.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed a simple and intuitive user interface that enhances the player experience.
Game Reset Functionality: Integrated a restart button that allows players to reset the game without refreshing the page.
This project showcases my skills in front-end development, particularly in building interactive web applications and implementing game logic with JavaScript.
